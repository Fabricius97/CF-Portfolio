        I'm a curious junior developer with a passion for crafting web
        experiences that people actually enjoy using. I specialize in React and
        love diving into things like Three.js to add a bit of "wow!" to my
        projects. While I may not know everything yet, Iâ€™m a fast learner with a
        "Google-first" problem-solving strategy (because letâ€™s be real, even
        senior devs do that). Iâ€™m all about creating simple, clean, and
        functional solutions â€” with just a hint of magic. Ready to turn some
        wild ideas into reality? Letâ€™s build something cool, and maybe break the
        internet (in a good way)! ðŸ˜Ž
      </motion.p>

      <div className="mt-20 flex flex-wrap gap-10">
        {services.map((service, index) => (
          <ServiceCard key={service.title} index={index} {...service} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default About;
